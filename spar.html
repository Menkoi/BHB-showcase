        <h2>What is Spar?</h2>
        <p>
          SPAR is an app aimed at improving your martial arts skills wether it be Tae Kwon Do, Muy Thai, Boxing, Kick Boxing etc. and uses google maps to find other 
          trainers in your area! The concept behind SPAR is that fighters from different background can meet up with other fighters and have some friendly competition.
        <br />
        <br />
        For example lets say that you mainly train in boxing, how would you know if your good enough to go up against someone who was trained in Muy Thai? well with SPAR 
        you can find someone in your area that you can train with and who knows maybe you might learn something from each other!
        <br />
        <br />
        One concept I though of with SPAR was the ability to create "squads" shown in the image above. With the squad feature you can find other trainers in the area and 
        different squads can train together! The goal was to have different squads rate each other preformance and the squad with most interaction and best rated will be 
        the top squad in the area so watch out there alot of competition out there!
        <br />
        <br />
        Another feature I thought of was the ability to have a livestream feature so instead of squads or the trainers rating each other we put that power to the people who
        can watch any training happening and they can rate who was the better preformer, however this is all just very early concept ideas.
